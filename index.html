      <p>
        On August 11th, Census Bureau offices across the country will begin
        Nonresponse Follow-up (also known as the “door-knocking phase”) by
        visiting homes that have yet to complete their 2020 Census form. Like
        much across our daily lives, the Census also adapted in several ways
        including moving the deadline to complete the Census from July to
        October 31st. With these needed changes comes the risk of falling into a
        false sense of security in believing that “we still have time”. While
        changes in the 2020 Census timeline provides more time for organizations
        and communities to Get-Out-the-Count, COVID-19 puts communities in
        danger of a severe undercount that will impact New Yorkers over the next
        decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of June 29th, only 57.2 percent of New York homes have responded to
        the Census placing our state 38th among all states. With the national
        response rate at 64.6 percent, New York and our country finds itself
        significantly behind where we were currently during the 2010 Census.
        This is especially true in communities experiencing racial and income
        inequality who are also the hardest hit by COVID-19. At the same time,
        we know these communities have been historically undercounted and are
        already at risk of undercounting young children in the 2020 Census.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next several weeks will prove to be a critical period in which
        organizations, community leaders, and Census advocates across New York
        City must be able to effectively reach and engage New Yorkers to
        complete the Census. The map below highlights response rates across New
        York City by Census Tract broken down by digital and total response.

        By looking at NYC self-response rates by tract and examples in each of
        the five boroughs (below), we can see just how consistent or varied
        response rates may be between different neighborhoods and the impact
        they may have on these communities especially in homes that have young
        children. For example:

        <p>
          In the Bronx neighborhood between Williamsbridge and Woodlawn Cemetery
          (Tract 398) 18.5 percent of households lack internet access and had
          either no home internet subscription or dial up-only – a fifth of the
          population. A majority Black/Immigrant neighborhood, a large share of
          children also live in immigrant families and in families led by a
          single parent who may be completing the Census for the first time.
          Knowing that the 2020 Census can be completed digitally, community
          resources providing internet access has been severely limited due to
          COVID-19 and represents a major challenge to finding other means to
          support families to complete their 2020 Census.

          Yet in neighborhoods that share similar undercount risks, communities
          such as Co-Op City have demonstrated opposite trends and represent
          nearly, if not, the highest response rates in New York City. Like
          Williamsbridge, Co-Op City has a high rate of internet inaccessibility
          with 1 in 5 homes without access to any internet subscription or
          dial-up only. The neighborhood also shares many other “at-risk”
          factors that lead to an undercount and would miss young children under
          five, yet through news, media, person-to-person engagement, community
          leaders, and other means –

        <!-- insert paragraph: census tract 84 -->
        <p>
          In Manhattan, neighborhoods in Midtown consist of multiple tracts that
          represent some of the lowest response rates across New York City. When
          considering the risk of undercounting young children, it is estimated
          that most or ALL children in Tract 84 live in immigrant families
          (primarily Asian) – a circumstance which historically is associated
          with lower response rates on the Census in general. In 2010, this same
          tract had a final self-response rate more than double the current
          rate. However, even in 2010, only about HALF (52%) of households
          responded to their census and ultimately were counted in their
          neighborhood. Being a neighborhood that has a large immigrant
          population, it is important to note that approximately 52 percent of
          all immigrants in this tract entered the United States after the 2010
          Census, making 2020 the first Census they would be completing.

        <p>
          In Sunnyside Queens (Tract 199.01) we again see the need to support
          families that often undercounted or missed in the Census. In this
          particular neighborhood/tract nearly a third of homes are composed of
          adults ages 18-34 that have less than a high school diploma, 16
          percent of homes have no one older than 14 years old who speaks
          English “very well”, all or nearly all children under 18 live in
          immigrant families, and a majority of the population lives in a
          renter-occupied housing unit. Focusing on one undercount factor,
          families who cannot access the form in their language, it is likely
          important to generate awareness and urgency about being counted by
          online, by phone, or on paper alongside language support and resources
          available from community based-organizations serving neighborhoods
          like Sunnyside.

          multi-family housing units at about 8 percent with this neighborhood.
          We know that an important factor in low census response rates are
          multi-family homes that difficult to identify as separate and distinct

          In the neighborhoods of Clifton and Stapleton in Staten Island the are
          several additional factors that add an increase risk and need to
          ensure children are counted in this and adjacent communities. Compare
          to previous examples mentioned, these neighborhoods also have a high
          share of children under five living in families experiencing poverty –
          representing a little more than 70 percent. More than half of all
          children under 18 live in a single parent household and about 18
          percent of children under six live with a grandparent.

        <p>
          Disparities seen here in comparison to communities such as Woods of
          Arden/Eltingville clearly demonstrate demographics that typically
          experience a lower Census response rate. Focusing engagement efforts
          in spaces (in person or remotely) where these families receive
          services and support provide one example of many that can increase the
          response rate for these communities in the Census.

        The examples above provide just a snapshot of some communities in New
        York City that need our full support to ensuring a complete and accurate
        count of all New Yorkers, including young children.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that the situations where people are missed and not counted are
        not just one but many and are clearly demonstrated here to impact
        children and families that have no or limited access to internet, are
        experiencing poverty, read/speak a language other than English, are
        immigrants, are renters, live in crowded or multi-family households,
        live in single parent households, and other situations that indicate
        barriers to being counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, these graphs and information also show that there are also clear
        examples of “at risk communities” defying the common narrative and
        demonstrating how dedicated efforts to Get-Out-the-Count using
        consistent and relevant engagement, community mobilizing, sufficient
        resources, and effective strategies can bring us closer to our goal of
        achieving a 100 percent response rate.
