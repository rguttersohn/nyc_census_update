      <p>
        On August 11th, Census Bureau offices across the country will begin Nonresponse Follow-up (also known as the “door-knocking phase”) by visiting homes that have yet to complete their 2020 Census form. Like much across our daily lives, the Decennial Census operation was also adjusted in several ways to accommodate the changes that the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it, including moving the deadline to complete the Census from July to October 31st.  With this needed change, comes the risk of falling into a false sense of security in believing that “we still have time”. While changes in the 2020 Census timeline provides more time for organizations and communities to Get-Out-the-Count, limitations on in-person Census events due to COVID-19 puts many communities in danger of a severe undercount that will impact New Yorkers over the next decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of July 14th, the national Census self-response rate was 62.1%. In New York State, only 57.6%of homes have responded to their Census, placing our state 38th In the country. While our state and nation’s Census response rates lag significantly relative to the 2010 Census, this is especially true in communities experiencing racial and income inequality who are also the hardest hit by COVID-19. Many of which have been historically undercounted and are already at heightened risk of undercounting young children in the 2020 Census. It is critical that these communities are accurately counted on the census, to democratize the distribution of federal resources at a time where economic uncertainty is a reality for communities across the country. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The next several weeks will prove to be a critical period in which organizations, community leaders, and Census advocates across New York City must be able to effectively reach and engage New Yorkers to complete the Census. The map below highlights response rates across New York City by Census Tract broken down by digital and total response.

        By looking at NYC self-response rates by tract and examples in each of
        the five boroughs (below), we can see just how consistent or varied
        response rates may be between different neighborhoods and the impact
        they may have on these communities especially in homes that have young
        children. For example:

      <h2>Census Tract Spotlight</h2>
      <p>
        By looking at New York City’s 2020 census response rates by census
        tract, a small NYC geography with populations between 3,000 to 4,000, we
        can identify areas of the city where the 2020 census response rates are
        increasing, and areas which are significantly behind the citywide
        progress by seeing the percentage of households which have completed
        their census forms only, by phone, or by internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, we have identified examples of census tracts within the five
        boroughs and take a deeper look into the tract’s census response rates,
        demographics, and adjacent neighborhoods. This allows us to see just how
        consistent or varied response rates may be between different
        neighborhoods and where we may focus our Census efforts on especially in
        homes with situations that contribute to an undercount of young
        children. We will refer to census tracts by the name of their
        corresponding <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/nyc-population/geographic-reference.page" target="_blank">Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) name</a>.

        These examples across the five boroughs of New York City provide a brief
        snapshot of response rates and examples of the different types of
        barriers New Yorkers face in completing the Census. It is important to
        note that even though these examples highlight a particular barrier to
        families and young children being counted in the Census, it usually is
        not the only barrier that exists for the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that the situations where people are not counted plentiful, and
        present obstacles to children and families that have no or limited
        access to internet, are experiencing poverty, read/speak a language
        other than English, are immigrants, are renters, live in crowded or
        multi-family households, live in single parent households, and other
        situations that indicate barriers to being counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, there are also clear examples of “at risk communities” defying the
        common narrative and demonstrating how dedicated efforts to
        Get-Out-the-Count using consistent and relevant engagement, community
        mobilizing, sufficient resources, and effective strategies can bring us
        closer to our goal of achieving a 100 percent response rate.
