      <p>
        On August 11th, Census Bureau offices across the country will begin
        Nonresponse Follow-up (also known as the “door-knocking phase”) by
        visiting homes that have yet to complete their 2020 Census form. Like
        much across our daily lives, the Census also adapted in several ways
        including moving the deadline to complete the Census from July to
        October 31st. With these needed changes comes the risk of falling into a
        false sense of security in believing that “we still have time”. While
        changes in the 2020 Census timeline provides more time for organizations
        and communities to Get-Out-the-Count, COVID-19 puts communities in
        danger of a severe undercount that will impact New Yorkers over the next
        decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of June 29th, only 57.2 percent of New York homes have responded to
        the Census placing our state 38th among all states. With the national
        response rate at 64.6 percent, New York and our country finds itself
        significantly behind where we were currently during the 2010 Census.
        This is especially true in communities experiencing racial and income
        inequality who are also the hardest hit by COVID-19. At the same time,
        we know these communities have been historically undercounted and are
        already at risk of undercounting young children in the 2020 Census.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next several weeks will prove to be a critical period in which
        organizations, community leaders, and Census advocates across New York
        City must be able to effectively reach and engage New Yorkers to
        complete the Census. The map below highlights response rates across New
        York City by Census Tract broken down by digital and total response.

        By looking at NYC self-response rates by tract and examples in each of
        the five boroughs (below), we can see just how consistent or varied
        response rates may be between different neighborhoods and the impact
        they may have on these communities especially in homes that have young
        children. For example:

      <p>
        The examples above provide just a snapshot of some communities in New
        York City that need our full support to ensuring a complete and accurate
        count of all New Yorkers, including young children.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that the situations where people are missed and not counted are
        not just one but many and are clearly demonstrated here to impact
        children and families that have no or limited access to internet, are
        experiencing poverty, read/speak a language other than English, are
        immigrants, are renters, live in crowded or multi-family households,
        live in single parent households, and other situations that indicate
        barriers to being counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, these graphs and information also show that there are also clear
        examples of “at risk communities” defying the common narrative and
        demonstrating how dedicated efforts to Get-Out-the-Count using
        consistent and relevant engagement, community mobilizing, sufficient
        resources, and effective strategies can bring us closer to our goal of
        achieving a 100 percent response rate.
